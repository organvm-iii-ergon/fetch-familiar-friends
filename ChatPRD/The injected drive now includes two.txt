<!-- AI Handoff Header -->
**AI Handoff Overview:** This document is structured for seamless agent transitions. Coordinate updates with the orchestration plan in `AGENT_ORCHESTRATION.md`.
<!-- /AI Handoff Header -->

The injected drive now includes two new reference documents and several templates to help you configure your projects:

* **Docs:** `docs/technical/software-stack-deep-dive_20251023.md` summarises your core development stack, per‑project packages and environment migration steps.  `docs/user/ai-handoff-user-summary_20251023.md` captures your personal profile, AI interaction protocols and an overview of your project architectures.
* **Templates:**  A `templates/requirements.txt` listing all the common Python packages, an `templates/env.example` with typical Flask/OpenAI/PostgreSQL variables, and a `templates/docker-compose.yml` showing a standard web+database setup.

To get started on a fresh machine:

1. **Mount and explore:** Verify the drive contents (`ls Z:/`) and open the deep‑dive and handoff docs under `docs/technical` and `docs/user` in your editor to familiarise yourself with the package lists and environment guidance.
2. **Set environment variables:** Export the `$Z_*` variables (or set them persistently) so the scripts know where to find `Z_ROOT`, `Z_SCRIPTS`, `Z_WORKSPACE`, etc.
3. **Install prerequisites:** Ensure Git, Python 3.10+, Docker Desktop (WSL 2 on Windows), VS Code with the Python and Docker extensions, and `pre-commit` are installed.  Refer to the “Summary of Local Environment Migration” in the deep‑dive document for details.
4. **Bootstrap:** Run `bash Z:/scripts/bootstrap` to generate a local `.env` and install Git hooks.  Use the example in `templates/env.example` to populate your project’s `.env` with appropriate secrets (API keys, DB credentials).
5. **Hydrate and verify:** Run `bash Z:/scripts/hydrate` to build devcontainers and seed any data, then `bash Z:/scripts/verify` to run linters, secret scans and ADR checks.  If you’ve stored snapshots, `bash Z:/scripts/verify-archive` will validate their checksums.
6. **Use the templates:**  For new services, copy `templates/requirements.txt` into your Python project and adjust as needed; copy `templates/docker-compose.yml` as a starting point for your `web`/`db` stack; base your `.env` on `templates/env.example`.
7. **Clone and build:** Clone any GitHub repos mapped in `cloud/repo-map.yml`, commit the new docs and templates, and run `docker-compose up --build` (with the generated `.env`) to start the web app and database.
8. **Review integration plans:** If you plan to use the Microsoft Power Platform for Majestic Design, sign in to your Microsoft 365 account and review the Power Apps / Power Automate requirements noted in the deep‑dive doc.

By following these steps and using the newly added documentation and templates, you’ll have a clear roadmap for setting up your development environment and deploying your projects on a fresh machine.

+# Software Stack Deep Dive – 2025‑10‑23
+
+**TL;DR:** Continuing from our last conversation, a deeper dive into your project history reveals a consistent Python & Docker stack. However, the specific packages expand to include AI/ML libraries (langchain, openai, pandas), web frameworks (flask, gunicorn), database tools (sqlalchemy, psycopg2‑binary), and real‑time/3D libraries (flask‑socketio, three.js). A key part of your software ecosystem, especially for your father's business, likely involves the Microsoft 365 / Power Platform (Power Apps, Power Automate, SharePoint) given your "Microsoft based business" [2025‑07‑15] and GoDaddy hosting [2025‑07‑15]. Your local dev environment would need to account for both this open‑source stack and any potential integrations with Microsoft's ecosystem.
+
+## [AJP‑05] Core Development Stack (Recap)
+This is the foundation for all your custom projects, as established previously:
+
+* **Languages/Runtimes:** Python (3.10+), JavaScript (for frontend)
+* **Containerization:** Docker Desktop (configured for WSL 2 on Windows)
+* **Version Control:** Git
+* **Code Editor:** VS Code with Python and Docker extensions
+
+## [AJP‑06] Project‑Specific Software & Python Packages
+Your history shows three distinct types of software development projects, each with its own package requirements.
+
+### [AJP‑06‑A] AI & Data Pipeline Projects
+These projects ("AI Council" [2025‑10‑13], "MET4morfoses/OS" [2025‑08‑24]) require a stack focused on AI, data, and streaming:
+
+* **openai:** The primary library for all OpenAI API interactions.
+* **langchain:** Used for orchestrating the AI agents for the "AI Council" debates.
+* **pandas:** For data manipulation within your "Unified Knowledge Pipeline."
+* **flask‑socketio / websockets:** For the "decentralized live streaming" component of the "AI Council."
+* **flask / gunicorn:** To serve the backend API that manages the agents and streams.
+
+### [AJP‑06‑B] Interactive Web Applications
+These projects ("Siddhartha" Journal [2025‑09‑17], "Buddhist Cosmology 3D Map" [2025‑10‑14]) are user‑facing web apps:
+
+* **flask (or django):** The web framework to build the sites.
+* **sqlalchemy:** The ORM to manage user data, journal entries, etc.
+* **psycopg2‑binary:** The Python driver to connect to a PostgreSQL database (the most common choice for Dockerized Python apps).
+* **flask‑login / flask‑bcrypt:** For handling user registration, login, and password hashing for the journal.
+* **three.js:** A JavaScript library included in your frontend static files (e.g. `/static/js`) and served by Flask for the 3D map.
+
+### [AJP‑06‑C] Business Process & Utility Apps
+These projects are for your father's business, Majestic Design (Materials Management, Equipment Requests, Daily Reports [2025‑07‑11], and the delay form for Nicholas [2025‑10‑09]). You have two likely development paths here:
+
+* **Python Web App Path:** Use the same stack as in [AJP‑06‑B] (flask, sqlalchemy) to build simple, internal web‑based forms.
+* **Microsoft Power Platform Path:** Given you are a "Microsoft based business," it is highly probable these tools are (or should be) built using:
+ * **Power Apps:** To create the forms for mobile/desktop use.
+ * **Power Automate:** To handle the approval/notification logic (e.g., "when an equipment request is submitted, email the manager").
+ * **SharePoint Lists / Dataverse:** To act as the simple database behind these apps.
+
+Your local "dev env" for this stack would be your web browser and a Microsoft 365 license.
+
+## [AJP‑07] Consolidated Environment Variables (.env file)
+Based on this complete list, your `.env` file for a complex project like the "AI Council" or "Siddhartha" journal should include:
+
+```env
+# --- Flask App Settings ---
+FLASK_APP=app.py
+FLASK_ENV=development
+SECRET_KEY=a‑very‑strong‑random‑key‑for‑sessions
+
+# --- OpenAI API Settings ---
+OPENAI_API_KEY=sk‑YourSecretKeyGoesHere
+
+# --- Database Connection (PostgreSQL) ---
+# These must match the 'environment' section of your db service in docker‑compose.yml
+DATABASE_URL=postgresql://myuser:mypassword@db:5432/mydatabase
+```
+
+## [AJP‑08] Summary of Local Environment Migration
+To move to a "ground zero" machine, you would need to:
+
+* **Install Core Tools:** Git, Python 3.10+, VS Code (with extensions), and Docker Desktop.
+* **Install OS‑Specific Needs:** On Windows, enable WSL 2 and configure Docker to use it.
+* **Log In to Services:**
+ * Log in to your Microsoft 365 account to access the Power Platform.
+ * Log in to GoDaddy to manage your domain and hosting.
+* **Clone a Project:** `git clone <your‑repo‑url>`.
+* **Create Local Files:** Inside the project, create the `.env` file and add your secrets (like `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
+* **Run the App:** Run `docker-compose up --build` from your terminal to build the images and start all services (your Python app, the Postgres database, etc.).
