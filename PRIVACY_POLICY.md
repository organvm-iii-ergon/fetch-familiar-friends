## Introduction

Welcome to DogTale Daily ("we," "our," or "the app"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our application.

## Our Core Privacy Principles

1. **Local-First**: All your data stays on your device by default
2. **No Tracking**: We don't track you or sell your data
3. **User Control**: You own your data and can export or delete it anytime
4. **Transparency**: We're clear about what we collect and why

## Data We Collect and Store Locally

All of the following data is stored **locally on your device** in your browser's localStorage. We do not have access to this data, and it never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export or share it.

### 1. Journal Entries
- **What**: Your daily journal entries about your pet
- **Why**: To help you track memories and reflections
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage on your device
- **Access**: Only you, through your browser
- **Retention**: Until you delete it or clear browser data

### 2. Favorite Images
- **What**: URLs of dog/cat images you've marked as favorites
- **Why**: To let you build a collection of images you love
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage (URLs only, not the images themselves)
- **Access**: Only you
- **Retention**: Until you delete them or clear browser data

### 3. Settings and Preferences
- **What**: Your theme choice, animation preferences, notification settings
- **Why**: To personalize your experience
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage
- **Access**: Only you
- **Retention**: Until you change them or clear browser data

### 4. Error Logs (Local Only)
- **What**: Technical error information if the app crashes
- **Why**: To help diagnose and fix problems
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage (never transmitted)
- **Contents**: Error messages, browser type (not full user agent), date (not timestamp)
- **Access**: Only you (viewable in Settings → Advanced)
- **Retention**: Last 10 errors only, automatically pruned

## Data We DON'T Collect

We explicitly **do not** collect, store, or have access to:

- ❌ Your personal information (name, email, phone, address)
- ❌ Your browsing history
- ❌ Your location data
- ❌ Tracking cookies or analytics
- ❌ Device identifiers
- ❌ IP addresses
- ❌ Usage patterns or behavior tracking
- ❌ Any data that could identify you personally

**No Server-Side Storage**: We do not operate servers that store your data. Everything stays on your device.

**No Analytics**: We don't use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or any tracking services.

**No Accounts Required**: You can use the app without creating an account, so we don't collect registration information.

---

## Third-Party Services

While we don't collect your data, the app uses external services to provide features:

### Dog Image API (dog.ceo)
- **Purpose**: Provides random dog images
- **Data Shared**: Your IP address (automatically sent with any web request)
- **Their Policy**: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
- **Control**: Requests only made when you use the app

### Cat Image API (thecatapi.com)
- **Purpose**: Provides random cat images (when you toggle to cat mode)
- **Data Shared**: Your IP address
- **Their Policy**: https://thecatapi.com/privacy
- **Control**: Requests only made when you use cat mode

**Note**: When you request an image from these services, they may see your IP address as part of standard internet protocols. We don't control their data practices. Please review their privacy policies.

## Data Security

### Local Storage Security
- **Encryption**: By default, localStorage is not encrypted. If you store sensitive information in your journal, consider using the browser's private/incognito mode or enabling device encryption.
- **Browser Security**: Your data security depends on your browser and device security. Keep them updated and use strong passwords.
- **Shared Devices**: Be cautious on shared computers. Use private browsing or remember to log out.

### Optional Encryption (Future Feature)
We plan to add optional journal encryption in a future update, allowing you to password-protect sensitive entries.

### What We Do
- ✅ Use HTTPS for all external requests
- ✅ Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- ✅ Follow secure coding practices
- ✅ Regular security reviews

### What You Should Do
- 🔒 Use a secure, up-to-date browser
- 🔒 Enable device encryption
- 🔒 Use strong device passwords
- 🔒 Be cautious on public/shared devices
- 🔒 Regularly back up important data

## Children's Privacy

DogTale Daily is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we don't collect any personal information at all, the app can be used by anyone, but parental guidance is recommended for young users.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.

**How We'll Notify You**:
- Major changes: In-app notification on next visit
- Minor changes: Updated date on this page

**Your Continued Use**: By continuing to use the app after changes are posted, you accept the updated policy.

## International Users

### GDPR (European Users)
For users in the European Union:
- **Legal Basis**: Legitimate interest (providing app functionality)
- **Data Controller**: Not applicable (we don't control or store your data)
- **Data Processor**: Not applicable (we don't process your data on servers)
- **Right to Complain**: Contact your local data protection authority

Since all data is stored locally on your device and we have no access to it, most GDPR provisions don't apply to our data practices. However, we respect GDPR principles in our design.

### CCPA (California Users)
For users in California:
- We don't sell personal information (we don't collect it in the first place)
- You have the right to know what data we collect (see above sections)
- You have the right to delete data (use in-app deletion features)

---

## Future Features

If we add cloud-based features (like multi-device sync) in the future, we will:
1. Update this Privacy Policy first
2. Make those features **opt-in only**
3. Clearly explain what data would be shared
4. Provide alternatives to keep using the app locally
5. Notify you before collecting any new types of data

**Current Status**: No cloud features planned for immediate release. All features remain local-first.
